# --- DataSets --------------------------- 
# --- Declare the URI for the dataset, specify where its structure is defined, 
# --- and what its label is.

# --- Data Structure Definition (DSD) --------------------------- 
# --- Declare the URI for the data structure definition, and then specify 
# --- the unit of measurement, which will be specified as 
# ---     sdmx-attribute:unitMeasure on the observations;
# --- the dimensions of the cube: refArea, refPeriod, sex,competition, 
# ---     and medaltype; 
# --- the measured variable: numberofmedals;
# --- and the label for the DSD.

# --- Dimension Properties ---------------------------
# --- Specify the properties for the dimensions that are not re-used from other
# --- vocabularies. 
# --- Competition is a dimension for which the possible values are defined
# --- at the URI specified for qb:codeList, and its values must be of the 
# --- type skos:Concept.
# --- The same goes for the medaltype dimension.

# --- Measure Properties --------------------------- 
# --- Define the properties of the actual measures in the observations. 
# --- In the DSD, we stated that qb:measure is the numberofmedals. 
# --- Here we specify that this numberofmedals property is an observation value,
# --- and that it must be an integer.

# --- ConceptScheme (Controlled Vocabulary) for Competitions ------ 
# --- When we defined competition as a dimension, we stated that its values 
# --- should come from a codeList. 
# --- Here we define that list of codes as a ConceptScheme, and then 
# --- each of the codes as Concepts within that ConceptScheme.

# --- ConceptScheme (Controlled Vocabulary) for Medaltypes ------ 
# --- When we defined medaltype as a dimension, we stated that its values 
# --- should come from a codeList. 
# --- Here we define that list of codes as a ConceptScheme, 
# --- which contains a Concept called allmedals, 
# --- which in turn has a skos:narrower relation to the bronze, gold, 
# --- and silver medal Concepts.

# --- Observations --------------------------- 
# --- We have two observations:
# --- The first observation is for gold medals won by female athletes 
# --- competing for the USA at the 2012 olympic games.
# --- We assign a URI to the observation,
# --- state that it is an Observation,
# --- and that it is within the Olympics data cube,
# --- that the unit of measure is a number, 
# --- that refArea is the country USA, i.e. the athlete was from the USA,
# --- that refPeriod is the year 2012, i.e. the 2012 edition of the games,
# --- that sex is female,i.e. the athlete in question is female,
# --- that the games were Olympics (as opposed to Paralympics),
# --- that the type of medal won was a gold medal,
# --- and that the number of medals won was 105.
